Complementary data that isn't available in the Client.

- Zone Lights : Those were hardcoded in the client in 3.3.5 and moved to a DBC file in Cataclysm. Can't edit them in 3.3.5 mode but it can be used for rendering.

- light_dbc_names : Contains names of Light.dbc entries. 
Extracted from legacy .lit files that were available until TBC beta for official Blizzard naming. https://wowdev.wiki/LIT
Users can also save custom Light names.
